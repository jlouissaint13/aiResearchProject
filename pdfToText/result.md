**Abstract:** The β-thalassemias are a group of hereditary hematological diseases caused by over
300 mutations of the adult β-globin gene. Together with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia syndromes

are among the most impactful diseases in developing countries, in which the lack of genetic

counseling and prenatal diagnosis have contributed to the maintenance of a very high frequency
of these genetic diseases in the population. Gene therapy for β-thalassemia has recently seen

steadily accelerating progress and has reached a crossroads in its development. Presently, data

from past and ongoing clinical trials guide the design of further clinical and preclinical studies

based on gene augmentation, while fundamental insights into globin switching and new technol­

ogy developments have inspired the investigation of novel gene-therapy approaches. Moreover,
human erythropoietic stem cells from β-thalassemia patients have been the cellular targets of

choice to date whereas future gene-therapy studies might increasingly draw on induced pluripo­
tent stem cells. Herein, we summarize the most significant developments in β-thalassemia gene
therapy over the last decade, with a strong emphasis on the most recent findings, for β-thalassemia
model systems; for β-, γ-, and anti-sickling β-globin gene addition and combinatorial approaches

including the latest results of clinical trials; and for novel approaches, such as transgene-mediated

activation of γ-globin and genome editing using designer nucleases.

## **Introduction**


The β-thalassemias are a group of hereditary hematological diseases caused by over
300 mutations of the adult β-globin gene, [1] with excellent reviews providing background
information outlining genetics, [2–4] pathophysiology, [5,6] and therapeutics [7] of β-thalassemia
that is beyond the scope of this review. In brief, β-thalassemia is brought about by
mutations reducing or abrogating β-globin expression, which thus lead to reduced adult
hemoglobin ([HbA] an α 2 β 2 heterotetramer) and excess α-globin content in erythroid
cells, in turn resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and apoptosis in the erythroid lin­
eage. [3,8,9] Most β-thalassemia patients therefore require lifelong clinical management
by blood transfusion and chelation therapy, [10–12] with a few having the option of cura­

tive but potentially hazardous allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) instead. [13,14] This indicates the need for alternative therapies,
and the observation that high levels of the fetal β-globin-like γ-globin chain result in an
ameliorated β-thalassemia phenotype [15] has prompted the search for γ-globin-inducing
chemical agents. [16–21] Patient response to known γ-globin inducers, however, is varied, [22]












Finotti et al


and the search continues for reagents with higher efficiency,
consistency, and tolerability in chronic application, [23] if not

to cure the disease, then to reduce transfusion requirements
and the significant cost of disease management. Of note,

hemoglobinopathies, such as the thalassemia syndromes
and sickle cell anemia (SCA; caused by the toxic β-globin [E6V]

mutation), most severely affect low-income countries, where

the lack of prevention programs and an underlying high
carrier rate bring about high disease frequencies, [24] although

global migration has now turned hemoglobinopathies into a
concern for many nonendemic countries as well. [25] Globally,
β-thalassemia mutations introducing gene deletions, aberrant

splicing, or premature stop codons have the greatest impact in
terms of global disease burden and clinical severity. [26,27] Recent
progress in the research of disease modifiers, [28] chemical
modulation of gene expression, [22,29] and tools and approaches
for DNA-based therapies [30,31] have opened new avenues toward

novel and more personalized strategies to manage or cure
β-thalassemia, as we have reviewed recently. [23,32] Particularly
with regard to curative approaches by gene therapy, the field



**Dovepress**


has come to a crossroads, with the initiation of clinical trials,

the possible plateauing off of incremental improvements to

gene augmentation therapy, and the increasing preclinical

application of novel genome-editing tools. The objective

of the present manuscript is to review the most relevant
findings published in the period 2005–2014 concerning

the preclinical and clinical application of gene therapy for
β-thalassemia. To this end, we will describe the pertinent
model systems, β-like-globin gene-addition strate­gies, gene

addition in combination with chemical inducers of γ-globin,

transgene-mediated activation of endogenous γ-globin, and
the emerging use of designer nucleases for β-thalassemia gene
therapy. The general flow of gene-therapy-based approaches
for β-thalassemia is outlined in Figure 1.

## **Experimental model systems**

Several experimental systems have been developed to establish

the suitability of and provide proof of principle for gene-­therapy
approaches to β-thalassemia. Erythroid cell lines, such as

human and murine erythroleukemia cells, allow cost-effective











**Figure 1** General view of a gene-therapy approach for β -thalassemia.
**Notes:** Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be the object of gene-therapy approaches. ( **A** ) The commonly
used CD34 [+] HSPCs and subpopulations may be corrected directly by gene therapy. ( **B** ) Alternatively, somatic cells can be isolated and reprogrammed to pluripotency,
with the resulting iPSCs then being a patient-specific substrate for gene therapy, clonal selection, and lineage-specific differentiation. Excepting circular arrows, solid arrows
indicate procedures for HSPCs and hollow arrows those for iPSCs. Circular arrows apply to HSPCs and iPSCs alike. Application of β -thalassemia iPSCs to patients is still
pending, as indicated by dashed arrows.

high-throughput assessments in the erythroid lineage, [33–36] and

cancer-prone mouse models have been instrumental in gaug­
ing the genotoxicity of integration and genome-modification
events for vector classes applied to β-thalassemia. [37–39] The most

informative functional studies of candidate therapies toward

their clinical application, however, instead rely on thalassemic

human stem cells for in vitro assessments of authentic human

responses and on thalassemic murine models for long-term

systemic assessments in vivo.

## In vitro experimental systems: erythroid precursor cells from β -thalassemia patients

HSPCs are the substrate for clinical gene-therapy applica­

tion, so that in vitro assessment of HSPC-derived erythroid

precursor cells (ErPCs) is highly informative for toxicity and
efficacy of any therapeutic intervention (Figure 1A). ErPCs

from peripheral blood are widely used, while access to bone
marrow and mobilized blood, [40,41] which, incidentally, contain
the cells preferentially used in clinical applications, [42,43] is

more restricted. Using peripheral-blood-derived ErPCs, it

is possible to obtain large cultures of relatively pure and

synchronized erythroid cell populations in which compounds
can be added at specific stages of maturation. In the proce­
dure developed by Fibach et al, [44,45] the culture is divided
into two phases: first, an erythropoietin (EPO)-independent
proliferation phase, in which peripheral blood cells are first

cultured in the presence of a combination of growth factors,

but in the absence of EPO; and, second, a differentiation

phase, when the culture, supplemented with EPO, generates

orthochromatic normoblasts and enucleated erythrocytes,

with cells decreasing in size and accumulating hemoglobin

(Hb) and large cellular clusters assuming a reddish color and
giving brown-red pellets upon centrifugation. [45,46] This system

recapitulates many aspects of in vivo erythropoiesis, includ­

ing globin RNA metabolism, cell cycle kinetics, expression

of cell surface antigens, iron and ferritin metabolism, and
recruitment of transcription factors, [45] and allows analysis

of Hb content by a variety of techniques, such as alkaline

denaturation, benzidine staining, capillary electrophoresis,

cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography

for hemoglobins, and reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography for globin chains. [45,46]

## In vitro experimental systems: human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been used

extensively to study the early phases of hematopoietic and



Gene therapy of β -thalassemia


erythroid development. [47] In this approach, after 5 to 7 days

of in vitro cell culture, a blastocyst is generated, showing a

clearly visible and easily accessible inner cell mass, from

which pluripotent stem cells can be isolated, giving rise to

in vitro hESC lines. From these cell lines, embryoid bodies
can be developed and used for further tissue-specific differ­

entiation. hESCs themselves have only a minor role in the
preclinical study of therapies for hemoglobinopathies, [48,49]

and their clinical application would suffer due to the ethical

repugnance of their origin and from the same incompatibili­

ties seen for allogeneic HSPC transplantations. However, the

underlying hESC methodology is being reemployed in the
culture of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), [50–53] which

closely mimic hESCs and represent a potential cornucopia

for cell-based therapies in general. The creation of iPSCs

from somatic cells with the use of reprogramming factors
(originally Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 [50] ) represented a

paradigm shift in our understanding of developmental biology

and in the conception of novel therapeutic approaches, not

least because their use avoids the ethical concerns associated
with hESCs and creates a patient-specific, histocompatible

substrate for cell therapy. Human iPSCs retain embryonic and

fetal characteristics of gene expression even upon erythroid

differentiation in vitro, so that the hope arose that patientderived iPSCs for β-thalassemia or SCA might be therapeu­

tic in their own right via the maintenance of high levels of
γ-globin expression (Figure 1B). [54,55] However, according to
recent in vivo findings after transplantation into immunode­
ficient mice, in which a gradual switch to the adult β-globin
gene was observed, [56,57] this hope appears to be unfounded.

Notwithstanding this apparent setback, iPSCs are a promis­
ing substrate for gene therapy, as they can be amplified in
vitro indefinitely (where they are, alas, still subject to the

same mutation rates and potentially undesirable changes as

any other cell type) and thus allow the clonal selection of

rare events of therapeutic interest. Since its inception, iPSC

technology has been used extensively in innovative studies
on β-thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies, as will
be detailed for specific gene-addition and genome-editing

approaches.

## In vivo experimental systems: mouse models

Thalassemic mouse models provide the most economical

option for gauging the putative and systemic effects of gene
therapy approaches in thalassemic patients. Of note, the regula­
tion of β-like globin chains in humans comprises a switch in

utero from the embryonic (ε) to the fetal (γ) chain, followed
by an HbA switch perinatally up to 6 months after birth, [58,59]

Finotti et al


which also allows the birth and early postnatal development
of homozygous β [0] patients without disease management. In
contrast, the murine β-globin locus encodes four functional
β-like globin genes: βh1 and ε [y] (transcribed only during the

embryonic phase of development up to E14–E15 of a total
gestation period of approximately 21 days), and the _b1_ (β [major] )
and _b2_ (β [minor] ) genes, which are transcriptionally activated in
utero around 11 days after conception. [59] Accordingly, mice
homozygous for (β [0] ) mutations that prevent expression of
the adult β-globin genes die perinatally, owing to a complete
lack of expression of any Hb. [59] The most widely used, nonhumanized adult murine models of β-thalassemia therefore
need to retain some β-globin expression and thus show fea­
tures similar to those observed for β-thalassemia intermedia
patients, who carry moderate to mild (β [+] ) mutations, [60] although
a β [0] surgical model of murine β-thalassemia major has also
been developed. [60,61]

In order to test the activity of novel mutation-specific

approaches in vivo, humanized mouse models needed to be
developed, [58] with those combining absence of murine β-like
globin genes with the presence of a human β-globin gene
cluster and mutated β-globin gene being of the greatest utility.
For instance, Vadolas et al [62] reported generation of a humanized
mouse model carrying the common β [+] IVSI-110 splicing muta­
tion on a bacterial artificial chromosome carrying the human
β-globin locus. Comparison of heterozygous β-globin knock­

out mice carrying either the IVSI-110 or the normal human
β-globin locus showed a 90% decrease in human β-globin

chain synthesis in the IVSI-110 mouse model. The model,

moreover, accurately recapitulates the splicing defect found in
β-thalassemia patients and is thus a suitable platform on which to

test approaches for the restoration of normal splicing. Similarly,

a humanized mouse model carrying the common G26A
(HbE) mutation, frequently co-inherited with β-thalassemia

in Southeast Asia, has been developed, which allows in vivo
analysis in mouse of therapies for HbE/β-thalassemia. [63] Mouse

models (whether of a wild-type or thalassemic background)
carrying all or parts of the human β-globin locus have also

proven an essential resource for the analysis of globin switch­
ing and therapeutic approaches for β-thalassemia. [64–66] Finally,

a keen interest in the study of developmental gene regulation,
γ-globin induction, and therapies for β-thalassemia major has

prompted the development of further humanized transgenic
mice as models for β-thalassemia major. [67] These mice carry a
mutated human β-globin gene and are born viable due to the

prolonged expression of human fetal hemoglobin (HbF), but

require chronic transfusion for survival and are not yet widely
available in the community. [67–69]

## **Globin gene addition**

Over the last 2 decades, major efforts have been made to
achieve therapeutic levels of exogenous β-like globin chains
in β-thalassemia and SCA. These finally came to fruition

when a switch from γ-retroviral vectors to lentiviral vec­
tors allowed the efficient transduction of nondividing cells
with a sufficiently large expression cassette, [70] encouraging

numerous research groups to work toward vectors expressing
β-globin, anti-sickling variants of β-globin and γ-globin.

## Lentiviral expression of exogenous β -globin

The efforts of the groups working in this field have been
dedicated to achieving highly efficient and stable transduction

of HSPCs, to optimizing transgene expression (erythroid- and
stage-specific, elevated, position-independent, and sustained
over time), and to correcting the β-thalassemia phenotype
in preclinical models with minimal genotoxicity. [35,36,40,42,71–75]
While the field has reached a high level of optimization, incre­

mental improvements to procedures and vectors continue to

be made. These include the use of rapamycin to enhance LV
transduction [76] and the recent inclusion of chromatin opening
elements [77–79] or an ankyrin insulator [72] for improved vector
derived expression, with an ongoing search for and evaluation
of alternative insulators [80] to prevent transgene silencing and

minimize host gene perturbation while avoiding the reduction

of vector titer during production that is associated with the
most widely used chicken HS4 insulator. [81] It has also been

demonstrated that, in order to avoid insertional mutagenesis,

it is possible to select suitable clones with insertions in inert

(“safe harbor”) genome sites, in combination with iPSC
technology. [82] Several recent reviews on gene therapy of thala­

ssemia and related hemoglobinopathies point out the state
of the art with respect to the structure of β-globin-carrying
lentiviral vectors, [70,83,84] and Figure 2A depicts a number

of therapeutic lentiviral vectors that produce high levels
of β-globin in human or murine β-thalassemic erythroid
cells. [35,36,40,42,71–75] Figure 2B and C illustrates how one such

vector, T9W, generates high-level HbA production in ex vivo
culture of HSPC-derived cells isolated from a β [0] -thalassemia
patient upon differentiation. [46]

## Lentiviral expression of anti-sickling β -globin and exogenous γ -globin

With a view to applying the same vector for β-thalassemia
and SCA, β-globin vectors have also been modified to

approach or even exceed the anti-sickling activity shown
by γ- and δ-globin. Of note are the HPV569 and BB305

LentiGlobin [®] vectors, [85,86] which feature in β [E] /β [0] clinical
trials [86–89] (see Clinical trials below) and carry β-globin [T87Q],

and which are expected to provide some anti-sickling
activity [90] and thus be suitable for SCA therapy. Particularly

important in this context, however, are the anti-sickling
β(AS3) β-globin designed by Townes et al [91,92] and pertain­
ing lentiviral vectors. [93] The combination of three amino
acid changes (creating the artificial b-globin [G16D, E22A, ]

T87Q variant) confers anti-sickling activity exceeding that
of γ-globin to β(AS3) and therefore renders the mutant



transgene ­particularly ­suitable for the therapy of SCA
and β-thalassemia/β-globin [E6V] compound heterozygotes.

Independently, and primarily with clinical application

for SCA in mind, numerous groups have also developed
retroviral vectors encoding γ-globin instead of β-globin
(Figure 3). [41,94–101] Of note, Wilber et al [41] used lentiviral vec­

tors encoding the human γ-globin gene with or without an

insulator, which were tested on erythroid progeny of normal

CD34 [+] cells and resulted in high levels of HbF produc­

tion, suggesting that lentiviral-mediated treatments have

Finotti et al


the potential to ­provide therapeutic HbF levels to patients.
These findings are corroborated by several independent

research groups that work on γ-globin-based lentiviral (and
γ-retroviral) therapy of SCA and β-thalassemia. [41,94–101] Fig­

ure 3A shows the structure of some of the corresponding
vectors. [41,96–99] All vectors intended for gene augmentation
described here, be it for the expression of β-globin, antisickling β-globin, or γ-globin, have overlapping fields of

application. Further preclinical and clinical studies will
show which vector may be most suitable for specific disease

conditions, with the vector itself as a key factor, but with

all components of the treatment protocol, including condi­

tioning, HSPC source and isolation, transduction protocol,

and general culture conditions, playing a critical role in the

outcome and in the comparison of vector performance.

## Combination therapy of gene addition with HbF inducers


Induction of endogenous HbF is one of the most widely
applied therapeutic strategies for β-thalassemia and SCA,
as indicated by several recent studies and reviews. [102–110]
Lending additional significance to preclinical studies, it

has been shown that the level of γ-globin mRNA and in

vitro induction of HbF in primary ErPCs isolated from



**Dovepress**


β-thalassemia patients is predictive of the hydroxyurea
response in vivo. [111,112] While most of the recent studies in
the field still focus on low-molecular-weight HbF induc­
ers, [102–110,113] the innovative strategy of combining them with
vector-derived β-globin has lately been investigated and

reviewed. [30,114] The combined treatment induces an increase

of both HbA (by gene addition) and HbF (by chemical HbF

induction) with important therapeutic implications, given that
β-like globin transfer in some β-thalassemia major ErPCs has

been unable to reach physiological levels of Hb in vitro and

might thus only lead to partial phenotypic correction in vivo
as well. Since increased production of HbF in β-thalassemia
is undoubtedly beneficial, the one-off application of gene

therapy combined with chronic application of HbF inducers
appears to be a pertinent strategy to achieve clinical benefits

not achievable with either strategy alone. Representative

results for this approach are depicted in Figure 4 on ErPCs
from a β [0] -thalassemia patient carrying the codon-39 stop
codon mutation (β [0] 39) (Figure 4A) and a β [0] 39/β-IVSI-110
thalassemia patient (Figure 4B). The results demonstrate that

this combination strategy achieves high levels of functional
Hb in β-thalassemic cells and a concomitant sharp decrease of
excess α-globin, with significant scope for further improve­
ments for what is as yet a nascent field of research.

## Clinical trials


To date, there are a total of seven patients who have been

treated successfully or for whom longer follow-up is pending
in three clinical trials for β-thalassemia, all of which have
used β-globin-expressing lentiviral vectors. The first success­
ful gene therapy trial for β-thalassemia [85] was reported in the
manuscript published by Cavazzana-Calvo et al in 2010 [87] and
commented on by Kaiser. [115] The pertaining β-globin [T87Q] vector
(LentiGlobin [®] HPV569) holds a tandem copy of the 250-bp
cHS4 insulator in its 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR) as a safety

feature and bears a T87Q amino acid, which, besides its con­

ferring anti-sickling activity, [90] makes it distinguishable from
transfusion-derived β-globin and thus allows the quantification
of vector-derived β-globin during follow-up. Three patients with
severe β [E] /β [0] -thalassemia have been treated to date. In the first

patient, engraftment of treated bone marrow failed after full

myeloablation, requiring reinfusion of backup bone marrow.

For the second patient, however, transfusion independence was



Gene therapy of β -thalassemia


achieved at 12 months after treatment and continues to date.

At 36-month follow-up, of 24 detectable clones in peripheral

blood, one clone with cross-lineage dominance held a proviral

integration in the high mobility group AT-hook 2 ( _HMGA2_ )

gene, whose expression is associated with tumor metastasis and
proliferation, [116,117] in a position that removed posttranscriptional

control elements and thus increased HMGA2 mRNA stability.

This clone, moreover, showed a recombination event that had

removed one of the cHS4 copies and possibly exacerbated

transcriptional enhancement of _HMGA2_ from the proviral
β-globin locus control region (LCR), with transcriptional and

posttranscriptional effects combined resulting in 10,000-fold

HMGA2 expression. Clonal dominance of this clone ­(peaking

at 22% of nucleated cells after 48 months) dropped to 6.8%

7 years after treatment. Notably, at 36 months, only one-third

of the total Hb was vector derived, with endogenous HbE and

unexpectedly high HbF constituting the other two-thirds, so that

the patient might have failed to become transfusion independent

in the absence of endogenous HbE and elevated γ-globin expres­

sion and if mild conditioning instead of full myeloablation

had been applied. Finally, engraftment with HPV569-treated

cells of the third adult patient for this trial was also successful.

However, the patient remains transfusion dependent, with a

low vector copy number (VCN) in the originally engrafted cell

material (VCN 0.3) and a low VCN in nucleated cells (VCN

in neutrophils 0.016), and with vector-derived Hb accounting

for only approximately 5% of total Hb more than 2 years after
engraftment. [88] Engraftment failure for the first patient, a low

VCN for the third patient, and oligoclonal reconstitution, vec­

tor recombination, and low vector-derived gene expression for

the second patient provide important pointers for necessary

improvements in future trials and vectors and, moreover, call

for ex vivo preclinical assessment in cells from prospective trial
participants, as we argue elsewhere. [72]


A second clinical study (HGB-205) and follow-up to the trial

described above has been initiated by bluebird bio Inc. in France
and utilizes the third-generation lentiviral LentiGlobin [®] BB305
vector. [86] Compared to HPV569, BB305 holds a cytomegalovirus

(CMV) promoter instead of the U3 promoter/enhancer in its
5′ LTR and no longer bears cHS4 insulator elements in its 3′
LTR. Preliminary results obtained for two β [E] /β [0] -thalassemia

patients, who had both been transfusion-dependent for most

of their lives, were encouraging, with a VCN of 1.5 and 2.1,

respectively, in the engrafted material and with a reported trans­

fusion independence at 3.5 and 6.5 months, respectively, after
treatment. [88] This success has most recently also prompted the
application of BB305 for gene therapy of SCA. [89]


Finally, an independent trial for globin gene transfer in
adult patients with β-thalassemia major has been initiated

(NCT01639690) by the Sadelain group and associates [118,119]
to study safety and efficacy, representing the first US trial
for β-thalassemia. The β-globin vector used for the trial,

TNS9.3.55, holds the cHS4 insulator and minor unpublished
modifications compared to TNS9. [60,71] A preclinical study test­

ing TNS9.3.55 in patient HSPCs in vitro, by BFU-E assays,
and, in vivo, using NOD-scid IL2rγ [null] mice, indicated high

vector-derived expression (73% to 100% of normal hem­

izygous levels) and long-term repopulation potential (69%
retention after 7 months) for vector-positive cells. [42] In the
ongoing clinical trial, five patients have been enrolled and

three treated to date, using G-CSF-mobilized CD34 [+] cells

and mild conditioning (8 mg/kg busulfan). Possibly owing

to the latter, which reduces the risk for patients but also the
level of donor chimerism and thus the overall efficiency

of the approach, transfusion independence had not been
reached 12 months after treatment in the first three patients,

albeit with an ongoing rise of the average VCN in peripheral

blood mononuclear cells (from, initially, 1% to 7%–9%)

and without the emergence of clonal dominance. As of this

writing, treatment of additional patients has been postponed
until fuller evaluation of the first three patients can indicate

whether dose escalation of the conditioning treatment might

be required.

## **Transgene-mediated activation** **of endogenous γ -globin genes**

Inspired by chemical induction of HbF as a therapeutic
approach, [102–109] and enabled by the burgeoning fields of
engineered transcription factors and RNA interference, [23,32]
a relatively novel approach to the therapy of β-thalassemia

is the transgenic activation of γ-globin, either by the over­

expression of γ-globin-activating transcription factors or by

the stable knockdown of γ-globin repressors.

## Overexpression of γ -globin-activating transcription factors

The β-type globin genes are activated through dynamic

interactions with a distal upstream enhancer, the LCR.

The LCR physically contacts the developmental stage
appropriate globin gene via chromatin looping, a process

partially dependent on the protein Ldb1. Deng et al showed
that tethering Ldb1 to the murine β-globin promoter with a
custom-designed zinc finger protein (ZF-Ldb1) can induce
loop formation and β-globin transcription in an erythroid cell
line. [120] Further work using a similar approach showed that

forced chromatin looping can be exploited to potently reac­

tivate fetal globin gene expression in adult human erythroid



**Dovepress**


cells. [121] For this work, a fusion protein that brings together a
zinc finger protein, which recognizes a specific sequence at
the γ-globin promoter, and Ldb1 was created. [120,122] Insertion

of a lentiviral vector carrying this fusion protein into adult

primary human erythroid cells strongly activated the γ-globin

gene, whose transcription accounted for nearly 90% of total
β-like globins and led to concomitant reduction of β-globin.

This approach would therefore be particularly suitable for the

therapy of SCA, by increasing anti-sickling γ-globin, while
at the same time reducing β [S] expression (see also [97] ).

Alternatively, engineered zinc-finger-based transcription

factors can be used to reactivate developmentally silenced

γ-globin genes in adult cells. Figure 3B shows the structure of
a lentiviral vector expressing the artificial zinc finger protein

GG1-VP64, which was designed to interact with the −117

region of the Aγ-globin gene proximal promoter and led to
a significant increase in γ-globin gene expression in K562
cells. [123] Moreover, Wilber et al [124] and Costa et al [64] reported

increased γ-globin gene expression following transfection
with GG1-VP64 constructs, with significantly increased

HbF levels in CD34 [+] erythroid progenitor cells from normal
human donors and β-thalassemia patients. These results pro­

vide new insights into the mechanism of γ-globin silencing

and may translate into mechanism-based, improved therapies
for β-thalassemia and related SCA.

## Transgene-mediated silencing of β -thalassemia modifiers

With the advent of the concept of RNA interference, efforts

began to utilize short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the therapy of β-thalassemia.
Early efforts, mindful of the amelioration of β-thalassemia

pathology by a reduction in α-globin excess, knocked down
α-globin mRNA to achieve a moderate but significant reduc­
tion in disease parameters, [34,125–127] an approach superior to

the alternative strategy of sequestering excess α-globin
protein by overexpression of its private chaperone, AHSP. [128]

Recently, regulation by RNA interference has also become an

option for the activation of endogenous γ-globin expression.

This was made possible through a growing understanding

of the regulation of globin switching, also by regulatory

microRNAs (miRNAs), and of transcriptional repressors of
γ-globin as therapeutic targets (see Figure 5). [129–144] Among
the candidate target genes for knockdown is the zinc finger

transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1, also known

as the erythroid Krüppel-like factor, EKLF), which acts as an
erythroid-specific master switch of globin gene expression [145]

and whose autonomy in directing globin gene expression is

underlined by the observation that the mere insertion of a
KLF1 binding site into the human δ-globin promoter confers

developmental inducibility and a reduction of the thalassemia
phenotype in mice. [146] Besides KLF1, Oct-1, [138] MYB, [139] and
BCL11A [129,133,140] have been identified as repressors of γ-globin
gene transcription. For instance, the zinc finger transcription

factor BCL11A has recently been shown to function as a

repressor of HbF expression, with transgenic deactivation of

BCL11A reactivating HbF and correcting a humanized sickle



Hb mouse model [147] and with BCL11A knockdown leading to
significant HbF induction in human cells, [129,133,140,144] similar
to knockdown of its positive regulator KLF1. [132] Moreover,

compound Klf1::Bcl11a mutant mice that carry the human
β-globin locus showed further enhanced γ-globin expres­
sion compared to single-mutant animals, [148] indicating that

a strategy targeting both genes together (without affecting

non-erythroid functions of BCL11A) might have additional
therapeutic benefits in β-thalassemia. In order to move

transgene-mediated activation of γ-globin from concept to

therapeutic application, shRNA expression from constitutive

RNA polymerase III promoters, such as the commonly used

U6 promoter (see Figure 3C), needs to be avoided. To this
end, Renella et al has surrounded a BCL11A-specific shRNA
with the flanking sequences of a naturally occurring miRNA

(miR223), allowing its (potentially regulated) expression from
RNA polymerase II-driven promoters. [149] Using lentiviral vec­

tors for spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)-promoter-driven

BCL11A shRNAmiR expression in murine erythroleukemia

cells, approximately 50% of control embryonic ε [y] levels were

achieved compared to the equivalent positive U6 shRNA

control, [150] so that controlled and stable shRNA-mediated HbF
induction has achieved an efficiency of potential clinical rele­

vance. Figure 5, in addition to transcription factors negatively
regulating the expression of the γ-globin genes, [151,152] shows

examples of miRNAs validated as regulators of γ-globin
gene expression, [153–156] either directly [155] or through interac­
tions with relevant target transcription-­factor mRNA, [153,154,156]
such as miR-15a and miR-16-1 (targeting MYB), [153] miR-23
and miR-27a (targeting KLF3 and Sp1, respectively), [156] and
miRNA-486-3p (targeting BCL11A). [154] Lentiviral vectors

carrying sequences of these miRNAs are expected to lead

to inhibition of γ-globin gene transcription-factor repressors

and induction of HbF. [41]

## **Genome editing**

In contrast to gene-augmentation approaches, the direct

DNA-level repair of primary mutations would achieve

physiological levels of gene expression for each corrected

cell and, in the absence of off-target activity, would alto­

gether avoid the risk of insertional mutagenesis inherent to

integrating vectors. Genome-editing approaches, however,
still suffer from low efficiencies in HSPCs, which, without

selection (eg, of iPSC clones) or enrichment steps, mostly

precludes their clinical application for gene therapy. However,
Genovese et al [157] have recently achieved high-efficiency tar­

geted DNA replacement in HSPC from controls and patients
with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, reaching
efficiencies of 3%–11% depending on the subpopulation,

thus moving homology-directed gene repair of HSPCs into

the realm of clinical application.

## Repair of causative mutations

Endogenous genomic loci can be altered efficiently and spe­
cifically using engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) [158–163]

and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TAL­

ENs), as recently reported by Voit et al for the human globin

locus. [164] Moreover, besides ZFN and TALEN, clustered

regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)

linked to Cas9 nuclease are now also being investigated for

bound to double-stranded target DNA. ( **D** ) The FokI nuclease introduces a nick in the spacer region of the target DNA, necessitating a dimer of two modules to introduce
a DSB in the target, while monomeric Cas9 suffices to introduce a DSB preceding its PAM site. Depending on the intended application, the DSB may then be repaired ( **E** )
by the template-dependent HDR mechanism (eg, for the repair of a causative mutation) or ( **F** ) by error-prone NHEJ (eg, for the disruption of γ -globin repressors or their
binding sites). The HDR approach has already been applied by Zou et al [158] and Ma et al [168] to correct the β -globin gene in induced pluripotent stem cells from sickle cell anemia
and β -thalassemia patients, respectively.

their ­utility in modifying β-globin. [165,166] ZFN (Figure 6A),

ΤALEN (­Figure 6B), and CRISPR (Figure 6C) comprise
a specifically engineered DNA binding domain fused to a
nuclease. [31] Binding of a ZFN or TALEN pair at contiguous
sequences flanking a target site leads to the dimerization of

the FokI (a double-stranded DNA nickase) domain, resulting

in a targeted DNA double-strand break, while CRISPR/Cas9

introduces double-strand breaks as a monomer. [31] To increase
target-site specificity and thus reduce off-target activity,

CRISPR linked to nickases and thus requiring dimerization
for genome modification are also being investigated. [167] The

resulting double-strand break (Figure 6D) can be repaired by
error-prone nonhomologous end joining or by high-fidelity

homology-directed repair in the presence of a homologous

DNA donor template (Figure 6E and F). In their study, Voit

et al engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce
modification of about 50% of human β-globin alleles near the

site of the sickle mutation. These TALENs stimulate targeted
integration of therapeutic, full-length β-globin complemen­
tary DNA to the endogenous β-globin locus in about 20% of
K562 erythroleukemia cells. [164]

Using patient-specific iPSCs, Ma et al [168] have recently
applied this technology to b-thalassemia, with Sun and Zhao [169]
likewise applying it to SCA patient-specific iPSCs, both groups

following the idea that correction of disease-causing mutations

offers an ideal therapeutic solution when iPSCs are available.
In the β-thalassemia study, Ma et al described a robust process
combining efficient generation of integration-free patientspecific β-thalassemia iPSCs and TALEN-based universal

correction of _HBB_ mutations in situ. Integration-free and gene
corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types

of homozygous mutations were generated. These iPSCs are

pluripotent, have normal karyotype, and, more importantly, can

be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells
and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal β-globin.

Interestingly, and of importance for any clinical application of

genome-editing tools, the correction process did not generate
TALEN-induced off-target mutations. [168]

## HbF activation by genome editing

In contrast to SCA, wherein a single mutation is present in
all patients, β-thalassemia is caused by a large variety of

mutations, each of which would have to be corrected by an

individually validated designer nuclease. The alternative and

universally applicable approach of using designer nucleases

to induce HbF instead is therefore an attractive option. While

results for this strategy as a gene-therapy approach have, to

our knowledge, not yet been published in peer-reviewed jour­

nals, it is already being employed, as patent applications for



Gene therapy of β -thalassemia


corresponding ZFN and TALEN indicate. [170,171] Intriguingly,

and depending on the target (such as a γ-globin repressor or

its binding site), this approach might use nonhomologous

end joining to disrupt the target sequence in HSPCs and thus
achieve high levels of efficiency that would allow a direct
translation to clinical applications for β-thalassemia.

## **Toward personalized** **therapy of thalassemia**

With hundreds of primary mutations, disease modifiers, and
polymorphisms linked to hereditary persistence of HbF, [1]
β-thalassemia patients can be stratified into clinically distinct

subgroups. It is expected, therefore, that the management of
β-thalassemia patients will increasingly be customized for
stratified classes of β-thalassemia patients, which will also

hold for intervention by gene therapy. For instance, with

the objective of reaching therapeutic levels of hemoglobins,

an optimized gene-therapy protocol might differ between
patients with β [0] genotypes (without endogenous β-globin
expression, such as β [0] 39 and β [0] -IVSI-1 homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes) and those with β [+] genotypes
(with residual β-globin expression, such as β [+] -IVSI-110 and
β [+] -IVSI-6 homozygotes or compound heterozygotes). In this

respect, the response of patients with compound heterozygote
β [0] /β [+] genotypes to exogenous β-globin expression might

need careful study. Moreover, in the case of mutationspecific genome editing, considerations of personalization

are inherent in the approach, while, for other approaches,

these considerations might be less obvious but similarly
critical. For instance, the efficiency of gene therapy based

on exogenous γ-globin gene expression or on the activation

of endogenous γ-globin by any of the means discussed above

may be in doubt in cases where the patients involved are

already expressing high endogenous levels of HbF. These

considerations also hold for the combination of gene therapy

and pharmacological induction of HbF detailed in the sec­

tion titled “Combination therapy of gene addition with HbF

inducers”, because the individual genetic composition is an

important cause of variations in the response and tolerance
to drug treatment, as recently reviewed. [30] Pharmacogenomic
based studies have clearly demonstrated that several genomic
variations (not restricted to the human β-globin gene cluster)
are significantly associated with differential responses of
β-globinopathy patients to treatment with chemical HbF
inducers, such as hydroxyurea. [172] This insight renders the

use of genomic/transcriptomic analysis to predict the in

vivo response and to guide the personalization of any such
therapy a logical conclusion. [111,112] With the same rationale,
the analysis of patient-specific responses in cell culture before

therapy, and, in particular, before permanent therapeutic
intervention, is strongly recommended [83] and will become

increasingly common. This trend, combined with the ex vivo

approach used for the therapy itself and with an increasing
use and creation of patient-specific iPSCs (in particular for

gene-correction approaches), is expected to lead to a dramatic

increase in biobanking of patient-derived cells, with all the
regulatory, management, and ethical issues involved. [173]

## **Conclusion**


In summary, gene therapy is one of the most promising
approaches for the future treatment of β-thalassemia patients

and comprises several, at times complementary, strategies.

The clinically most advanced approach, that of substituting
nonfunctional endogenous β-globin genes with a normal
β-globin gene carried by lentiviral vectors, leads to de

novo production of HbA. This approach can be enhanced,

as in vitro evidence indicates, by additional treatment with
inducers of endogenous HbF, which is firmly established
as clinically beneficial. In the same vein, numerous gene
therapy approaches also draw on HbF as a positive disease
modifier, either by expressing exogenous HbF from a lenti­

viral vector or by inducing endogenous HbF with a variety of
approaches, including the expression of exogenous artificial

transcription factors or the disruption of γ-globin repres­

sors or their binding sites. This latter approach has been

made possible by an increasingly detailed understanding of

globin gene regulation and by the development of rationally
designed artificial nucleases for genome editing. Designer

nucleases in turn now also allow gene editing of the human
globin locus and thus the correction of altered β-globin

genes as the most direct gene-therapy approach. As for the

cellular targets of gene therapy, human erythropoietic stem

cells have been considered in most studies and are still the

substrate of choice for clinical applications. However, it can
be expected that iPSCs from β-thalassemia patients will play

an increasing role in preclinical, and possibly clinical, gene
therapy studies in the future.


As a result of all these developments, and after decades in
the making, gene therapy of β-thalassemia has reached a criti­

cal phase and is beginning to live up to its long-held promise.

At this privileged moment in time, the model systems and

protocols are in place to test gene-therapy approaches, and
the first clinical trials show therapeutic efficiency and guide

our decisions for future developments, such as the choice of

conditioning regimen (full or mild), the HSPC source (bone
marrow-derived or mobilized), and the inclusion of ­insulators

for gene augmentation. Ongoing optimization of extant



**Dovepress**


gene-augmentation tools and combinatorial approaches with
chemical reagents are approaching therapeutic efficiency,

even for severe forms of the disease. At the same time,

fundamental insights into globin switching and new tools

for cellular reprogramming, transcriptional regulation, post­

transcriptional silencing, and genome editing have opened up

as-yet uncharted territory in what has become a fast-moving
and highly competitive field of research. While there is no

telling which approach will win out for widespread clinical

application in the course of time, vigilance, widespread

competence in shared methodology, and the availability of

diametrically different treatment strategies will provide the
pressure and scope for fast improving efficacy and safety, for
the good of the field and for the benefit of the patients.
